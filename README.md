Fancy Imagebar module for webtrees

The development version of the module requires [webtrees 1.5.4](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees).

## Description

The Fancy Imagebar is a nice looking imagebar between header and content of your webtrees homepage or my page.

You can determine which images you want to show in the Fancy Imagebar on the Fancy Imagebar configuration page. However, there are a few restrictions:

*   Only local ’jpg’ or ’png’ images which are set as type = ’photo’ can be used.
*   External images are not supported.
*   It is not possible to keep transparency for png thumbnails in the Fancy Imagebar.

On the Fancy Imagebar Configuration page you can set some other options too:

*   Show Imagebar on Homepage and/or My Page
*   Show random images (the sequence of the images in the Fancy Imagebar will change with every page refresh).
*   Image tone: Sepia, Color or Black and White
*   Amount of Sepia
*   Image size.

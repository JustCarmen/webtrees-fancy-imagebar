Introduction
------------
The Fancy Imagebar is a nice looking imagebar between header and content of your webtrees website.

There is a configuration page in control panel where you can set a few options. For performance reasons the options are less extended as in webtrees 1, but in most cases the provided options will be sufficient.

You can choose the folder(s) which contains the images you want to show in the Fancy Imagebar and set the desired image type (leave empty to show all). Further you can set the height of the imagebar and opt for square thumbnails. External images are not supported. It is possible to set a different configuration per tree.

A cool new feature is that the images in the imagebar are clickable now. By clicking an image the user is redirected to the individual page, family page or source page the image is linked to. In case an image contains mulitple links, the first link found is used.

Translations
------------
You can help to translate this module. The language files are at [POEditor][3] where you can update them. Or use a local editor, like Poedit or Notepad++ to make the translations and send them back to me. You can do this via a pull request (if you know how) or by e-mail. Updated translations will be included in the next release of this module.

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Unpack the zip file and place the folder jc-fancy-imagebar in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default. Go to the control panel to set some options.
